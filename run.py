Dice Auto Apply Bot Runner
==========================

This script serves as the primary entry point for launching the Dice automation bot.
It isolates environment-level configurations before instantiating the Tkinter GUI.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Validates and enforces proper PYTHONPATH configurations so that the `core` 
   modules can be loaded smoothly regardless of where the script is executed from.
2. Intercepts the startup sequence to execute `fix_chromedriver_permissions`. 
   This safely handles OS-level execution blockers that commonly prevent 
   Selenium webdrivers from launching natively on Mac/Linux or restricted Windows setups.
3. Bootstraps the main Tkinter Window loop housed within `app_tkinter.py`.
